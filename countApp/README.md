## How to Build

To build the Counter sample application:

1. Click on the **Downloads** tab above.
2. Select **Download as zip** (Windows) or **Download as tar.gz** (Mac) and save the downloaded file to your local machine.
3. Create a new folder on your local machine named **Counter** e.g. **C:\Documents and Settings\User\WebWorks\Counter** (Windows) or **~/WebWorks/Counter** (Mac).
4. Open the downloaded ZIP file from step 2 and extract the contents **from inside the zipped Counter folder** to your local **Counter** folder from step 3.  This ensures that the necessary application assets, such as **config.xml**, are correctly located at the top level of the local **Counter** folder (e.g. **~/WebWorks/Counter/config.xml**).
5. Using the **[Ripple Mobile Emulator](http://developer.blackberry.com/html5/download)** and either the **[BlackBerry WebWorks SDK for BB10](http://developer.blackberry.com/html5/download)**, package the contents of your local **Counter** folder into a BlackBerry application.  Enter the project root settings field as the local folder created in step 3, and the archive name settings field as **Counter**.
