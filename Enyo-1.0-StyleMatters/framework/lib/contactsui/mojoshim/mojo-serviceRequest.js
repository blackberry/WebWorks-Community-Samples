/**
 * Mojo.Service
 * API to interact with webOS device services.
 *
 * A service is an on-device "server" for any resource, data, or configuration
 * that can be exposed for developers to use with their applications. 
 * They are called "services" instead of servers so that it was clear that 
 * they were on the device rather than "in the cloud".
 *
 * The Web is built on Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs), so Palm uses
 * this scheme for identifying resources. Here is an example:
 *
 *      palm://com.palm.contacts/
 *
 * This is the name of the Contacts service in the system. Each service is 
 * then able to provide methods, with an optional category, for clients to
 * invoke.
 *
 * It becomes the responsibility of the service to provide both service names
 * to the service and maintain backwards compatibility. Helpers in the APIs 
 * aid this process.

/**
 * class Mojo.Service.Request
 *
 * All data passed in a request to a service, and all data returned 
 * from a service is encoded as a JSON object. 
 * The exact names and values passed in and out are service-dependent, 
 * but some conventions must be followed for a service to be considered correct and conforming.
 *
 *
 * If a client wants to get the system time of the device, they would make a 
 * request to 
 *
 *      palm://com.palm.systemservice/getSystemTime
 *
 * with the optional JSON argument `{subscribe: true}` if they wish to 
 * subscribe for updates. "Subscribing" means that the request will return to the `onSuccess`, `onFailure`, and `onComplete` calls 
 * specified in the initial request each time. Subscribed requests will return with a subscriber id.
 *
 * If the request is successful, the returned result of this request would be: 
 *
 *      {
 *          "localtime": localTimeInSecs,
 *          "offset", offsetFromUTCInMins,
 *          "timezone": timeZone
 *      }
 *
 * The `onSuccess` callback is called back during a successful request,
 * `onFailure` is called for a failed request (either a failure at the dbus or the service side will cause this), 
 * and `onComplete`, if specified, is always called last after a request returns.
 *
 *
 * Or for the request in code (this would be placed in an application scene assistant):
 *
 *         this.controller.serviceRequest('palm://com.palm.systemservice', {
 *             method: 'getSystemTime',
 *             parameters: { subscribe: true },
 *             onSuccess: this.handleResponse // this is a callback function
 *                                            // you would declare in the scene assistant
 *         });
 *
 * When creating a [[Mojo.Service.Request]] in the manner above, request references are managed by the scene
 * and are removed on completion of the request, unless the request has `subscribe: true`,
 * in which case the requests are cleaned up when the scene is popped.
 *
 * If the request needs to be retained beyond the lifetime of the scene, create a new [[Mojo.Service.Request]]
 * and manage the request object yourself.
 **/

/**
 * new Mojo.Service.Request(url, options, requestOptions)
 * - url (String): URL of the service request as defined in the developer guide
 * - options (Object): hash value containing the options for the specific service request call
 * - requestOptions (boolean | Object): either true, meaning to resubscribe automatically on error,
 *   or an object with a resubscribe property of true or false
 *
 * It's advisable to explicitly cancel a service request that you have created this way to ensure that it is removed.
 *
 * JS Example
 * ----------
 *
 *         var myServiceObject = new Mojo.Service.Request('palm://com.palm.systemservice', {
 *             method: 'getSystemTime',
 *             parameters: { subscribe: true },

 *         }, {
 *            resubscribe: true
 *         });
