/**
A control designed to be rendered multiple times. Typically, controls provide dynamic 
behavior in response to events and effect changes in rendering. Because flyweight is rendered
multiple times, the question comes up: which rendering of the flyweight should update when an event occurs?
To address this issue, whenever a DOM event is processed by a Flyweight object or any of its children, the flyweight 
automatically updates itself and its children to point to the rendering of itself in which the event occurred.
