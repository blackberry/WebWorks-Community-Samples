/**
	_enyo.Scroller_ provides touch-based scrolling for controls placed inside it.
	See <a href="#enyo.BasicScroller">enyo.BasicScroller</a> for more information.

	In addition to providing all the functionality of a BasicScroller, enyo.Scroller ensures
	that the dimensions of the scroller content are at least as large as the dimensions of the scroller itself.

	Since this is typically desirable--it allows a background image to expand to fit the scroller, for
	one thing--applications should generally use enyo.Scroller.
