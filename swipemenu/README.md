## How to Build

To build the swipemenu sample application:

1. Click on the **Downloads** tab above.
2. Select **Download as zip** (Windows) or **Download as tar.gz** (Mac) and save the downloaded file to your local machine.
3. Create a new folder on your local machine named **swipemenu** e.g. **C:\Documents and Settings\User\WebWorks\swipemenu** (Windows) or **~/WebWorks/swipemenu** (Mac).
4. Open the downloaded ZIP file from step 2 and extract the contents **from inside the zipped swipemenu folder** to your local **swipemenu** folder from step 3.  This ensures that the necessary application assets, such as **config.xml**, are correctly located at the top level of the local **swipemenu** folder (e.g. **~/WebWorks/swipemenu/config.xml**).
5. Using the **[Ripple Mobile Emulator](http://developer.blackberry.com/html5/download)** and either the **[BlackBerry WebWorks SDK for Smartphone](http://developer.blackberry.com/html5/download)** or the **[BlackBerry WebWorks SDK for Tablet OS](http://developer.blackberry.com/html5/download)**, package the contents of your local **swipemenu** folder into a BlackBerry application.  Enter the project root settings field as the local folder created in step 3, and the archive name settings field as **swipemenu**.

## Troubleshooting

1. Menu doesn't appear when I swipe down - check to make sure you have added the "blackberry.app.event" feature to config.xml.
2. Outer frame of the menu bar appears, but nothing else - make sure you have defined a callback function for the addButton step (without it, runtime error interrupts menu creation).
3. Images appear broken - ensure the path to your image files is correct and they are accesible by your application.
4. The font style is wrong - swipemenu.js inherits the font-style from your application. Add a body-tag CSS definition that sets the font-family property.
4. I don't like the background, colors, sizes - These can be customized.  Open and edit swipemenu.js. Modify the createSwipeMenu() and addButton() sections to set the styles you prefer.
